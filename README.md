# Neural Networks from MRAI workshop

This is work was performed as part of the MRAI workshop (MIDL 2019 satellite meeting) with exercises designed by Esther Puyol (https://github.com/estherpuyol/MRAI_workshop).

The original networks from the workshop were built using the pytorch library, as a learning exercise I have transferred these to TensorFlow (this also prevents any copy/paste answers!).

## Networks

### LV_segmentation
This network uses a unet style network to automatically segment the left ventricle from short axis cardiac MR images.
